*Averaging up to 20% of weight loss, adults taking Zepbound had at least 25 fewer breathing interruptions each hour as they slept*
*Up to 50% of adults taking Zepbound no longer had symptoms associated with OSA after one year*
INDIANAPOLIS,Dec. 20, 2024/[PRNewswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/)/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Zepbound®(tirzepatide) as the first and only prescription medicine for adults with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity.1Zepbound may help adults with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity improve their sleep disorder. It should be used with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.
&quot;Too often, OSA is brushed off as 'just snoring' —but it's far more than that,&quot; saidJulie Flygare, J.D., president and CEO of Project Sleep. &quot;It's important to understand OSA symptoms and know that treatments are available, including new options like Zepbound. We hope this will spark more meaningful conversations between patients and health care providers and ultimately lead to better health outcomes.&quot;
OSA is a sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by complete or partial collapses of the upper airway during sleep, which can lead to pauses in breathing (apnea) or shallow breathing (hypopnea) and a potential decrease in oxygen saturation and/or waking from sleep. One of the hallmarks of OSA is snoring, but fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness and disrupted sleep are also key symptoms, making this serious condition easily overlooked.
&quot;Today, many cases of OSA go undiagnosed and untreated, leaving millions at risk for serious health consequences,&quot; saidPatrik Jonsson, executive vice president, and president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and LillyUSA. &quot;Zepbound is the first medication that significantly improves moderate-to-severe OSA and aids in long-term weight loss in adults with obesity. Nearly half of clinical trial patients saw such improvements that they no longer had symptoms associated with OSA, marking a critical step forward in reducing the burden of this disease and its interconnected health challenges.&quot;
This approval was based on results from the SURMOUNT-OSA phase 3 clinical trials, which evaluated Zepbound (10 mg or 15 mg) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe OSA in adults with obesity, with and without positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy over the course of a year. Zepbound was about five times more effective than placebo in reducing breathing disruptions in adults not on PAP therapy, leading to 25 fewer breathing disruptions per hour with Zepbound and five with placebo. In adults on PAP therapy, Zepbound led to 29 fewer breathing disruptions per hour compared to six with placebo. After one year, 42% of adults on Zepbound and 50% of adults on Zepbound with PAP therapy experienced remission or mild, non-symptomatic OSA, compared to 16% and 14% on placebo, respectively.
In addition to improved OSA symptoms, adults on Zepbound lost an average of 45 lbs (18%) of their body weight, while adults on Zepbound with PAP therapy lost an average of 50 lbs (20%) of their body weight, compared to 4 lbs (2%) and 6 lbs (2%) on placebo, respectively.
Zepbound contains tirzepatide and should not be used with other tirzepatide-containing products or any GLP-1 receptor agonist medicines. It is not known if it is safe and effective for use in children.  Zepbound may cause tumors in the thyroid, including thyroid cancer. Watch for possible symptoms, such as a lump or swelling in the neck, hoarseness, trouble swallowing or shortness of breath. If you have any of these symptoms, tell your health care provider. Do not use Zepbound if you or any of your family have ever had a type of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Do not use Zepbound if you have Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Do not use Zepbound if you have had a serious allergic reaction to tirzepatide or any of the ingredients in Zepbound. Stomach problems, sometimes severe, have been reported in people who use Zepbound. Tell your health care provider if you have stomach problems that are severe or will not go away. The most common side effects of Zepbound include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, stomach (abdominal) pain, indigestion, injection site reactions, feeling tired, allergic reactions, belching, hair loss and heartburn. These are not all the possible side effects of Zepbound. Talk to your health care provider about any side effect that bothers you or doesn't go away.

This is the second indication in the U.S. for Zepbound in just over a year, following the FDA approval for adults with obesity or overweight who also have weight-related medical problems inNovember 2023.

**About SURMOUNT-OSA**
SURMOUNT-OSA (NCT05412004) was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-master protocol comparing the efficacy and safety of Zepbound®(tirzepatide) to placebo in adults living with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity who were unable or unwilling to use positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy (Study 1) and those who were and planned to stay on PAP therapy during the duration of the trial (Study 2). Under a master protocol, the trials randomized 469 participants across the U.S.,Australia,Brazil,China, Czechia, Germany, Japan, Mexico and Taiwan in a 1:1 ratio to receive Zepbound maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 10 mg or 15 mg or placebo. The primary objective of both studies was to demonstrate that Zepbound is superior in change in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from baseline at 52 weeks as compared to placebo.
SURMOUNT-OSA utilized an MTD of 10 mg or 15 mg once-weekly. The starting dose of 2.5 mg Zepbound was increased by 2.5 mg every four weeks until maximum tolerated dose was achieved. Participants who tolerated 15 mg continued on 15 mg as their MTD. Participants who tolerated 10 mg but did not tolerate 15 mg continued on 10 mg as their MTD.

*Chinais the fourth major market where Kisunla has received approval*
*Kisunla was first approved in the United States in July 2024, approved in Japan in September 2024 and then inGreat BritaininOctober 2024*
INDIANAPOLIS,Dec. 17, 2024/[PRNewswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/)/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced that the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) inChinahas approved Kisunla™ (donanemab-azbt, 350 mg/20 mL every four weeks injection for IV infusion), Eli Lilly and Company's (NYSE: LLY) Alzheimer's treatment for adults with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, which includes people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as people with the mild dementia stage ofAlzheimer's diseasewho have confirmed amyloid pathology.1,2
Chinais the fourth major market in which Kisunla has been approved for use, following approvals inthe United States,JapanandGreat Britain. InChina, it is estimated that nearly 6% of people over the age of 65 are living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, with nearly 11% over the age of 65 expected to be living with Alzheimer's disease by 2050.3
&quot;Bringing Alzheimer's disease treatment options to the people facing its devastating effects is critical. Patients and their families want and deserve access to treatment with amyloid targeting therapies, which could give them more time to do the things that matter most to them in the early symptomatic stage of the disease,&quot; said Ilya Yuffa, executive vice president and president of Lilly International, Eli Lilly and Company. &quot;Kisunla continues to demonstrate very meaningful results for people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and can now help to improve the standard of care for people living with the disease inChina.&quot;
Amyloid is a protein produced naturally in the body that can clump together to create amyloid plaques. Kisunla is an amyloid plaque-targeting therapy that can help the body remove the excessive buildup of amyloid plaques in the brain, which may lead to memory and thinking issues associated with Alzheimer's disease.4-5Kisunla can help slow the decline that may diminish people's ability to remember new information, important dates, and appointments; plan and organize; make meals; use household appliances; manage finances; and be left alone.4-7Kisunla is the only amyloid plaque-targeting therapy with evidence to support stopping therapy when amyloid plaques are removed, which can result in lower treatment costs and fewer infusions.6,8-10
**Results from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase 3 Study**
The application to the NMPA was based on the efficacy and safety data from TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase 3 clinical study.
In the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase 3 study, people who were the least advanced in the disease experienced the strongest results with Kisunla. Trial participants were analyzed over 18 months in two groupings: one group who was less advanced in their disease (those with low to medium levels of tau protein) and the overall population, which also included participants with high tau levels.2,11-12Treatment with Kisunla significantly slowed clinical decline in both groups.2Those individuals treated with Kisunla who were less advanced in their disease showed a significant slowing of decline of 35% compared with placebo on the integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS), which measures memory, thinking, and daily functioning. In the overall population, the response to treatment was also statistically significant using the iADRS at 22%.2,13
Among the two groups analyzed, participants treated with Kisunla had up to a 39% lower risk of progressing to the next clinical stage of disease than thosetaking placebo.14
Among the overall population of participants, Kisunla reduced amyloid plaques on average by 61% at 6 months, 80% at 12 months, and 84% at 18 months compared to the start of the study.2,15One of the treatment goals of the study was to remove amyloid plaques to minimal levels consistent with a visually negative scan using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET). If participants were confirmed to have reached these levels, they were able to complete treatment with Kisunla and switch to placebo for the remainder of the study. In the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study, 66% of patients achieved plaque clearance (based on above criteria) at one year.16
Kisunla can cause amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), which is a potential side effect with amyloid plaque-targeting therapies that does not usually cause symptoms. It can be detected via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and, when it does occur, may present as temporary swelling in an area or areas of the brain, which usually resolves over time, or as small spots of bleeding in or on the surface of the brain. Infrequently, larger areas of bleeding in the brain can occur.2,17ARIA can be serious, and life-threatening events can occur. Kisunla can also cause certain types of allergic reactions, some of which may be serious and life-threatening, that typically occur during infusion or within 30 minutes post-infusion. Headache is another commonly reported side effect. See the*Indication and Safety Summary with Warnings*below for additional information.
**About Kisunla™ (donanemab-azbt)**
Kisunla™ (donanemab-azbt) (pronounced kih-SUHN-lah) is an amyloid-targeting treatment for people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well as people with mild dementia stage of early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, with confirmed amyloid pathology. Kisunla can cause serious side effects, including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA, and infusion-related reactions. Kisunla is a prescription medicine administered intravenously every four weeks, 700 mg for the first three doses and 1400 mg thereafter.
**About TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Study and the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ program**
TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 ([NCT04437511](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4327487-1&amp;h=1195272226&amp;u=https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4259658-1&h=1001249353&u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT04437511&a=NCT04437511&amp;a=NCT04437511)) is a Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of donanemab in participants with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (MCI or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) with the presence of confirmed Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. The trial enrolled 1,736 participants, across 8 countries, selected based on cognitive assessments in conjunction evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathology. The Phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study results were[published](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4327487-1&amp;h=2046827960&amp;u=https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4259658-1&h=933559853&u=https%3A%2F%2Fjamanetwork.com%2Fjournals%2Fjama%2Farticle-abstract%2F2807533&a=published&amp;a=published)in the*Journal of the American Medical Association*(JAMA).
Lilly continues to study donanemab in multiple clinical trials, including TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, which is focused on preventing symptomatic Alzheimer's disease in participants with preclinical AD; TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 5, a registration trial for early symptomatic AD currently enrolling in China,Taiwan, Korea,Australiaand the UK; and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6, which is focused on expanding our understanding of ARIA through novel MRI sequences, blood-based biomarkers, and different dosing regimens of donanemab.
**U.S. INDICATION AND SAFETY SUMMARY WITH WARNINGS**
**Kisunla™ (donanemab-azbt)**, pronounced kih-SUHN-lah, is used to treat adults with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD), which includes mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stage of disease.
**Warnings - Kisunla can cause Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities or &quot;ARIA.&quot; This is a common side effect that does not usually cause any symptoms, but serious symptoms can occur. ARIA can be fatal.**ARIA is most commonly seen as temporary swelling in an area or areas of the brain that usually goes away over time. Some people may also have spots of bleeding on the surface of or in the brain and infrequently, larger areas of bleeding in the brain can occur. Although most people do not have symptoms, some people have headaches, dizziness, nausea, difficulty walking, confusion, vision changes and seizures.
Some people have a genetic risk factor (homozygous apolipoprotein E ε4 gene carriers) that may cause an increased risk for ARIA. Talk to your healthcare provider about testing to see if you have this risk factor.
You may be at higher risk of developing bleeding in the brain if you take medicines to reduce blood clots from forming (antithrombotic medicines) while receiving Kisunla.**Talk to your healthcare provider to see if you are on any medicines that increase this risk.**
Your healthcare provider will do magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans before and during your treatment with Kisunla to check you for ARIA. You should carry information that you are receiving Kisunla, which can cause ARIA, and that ARIA symptoms can look like stroke symptoms.
**Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have any of the symptoms listed above.**
There are registries that collect information on treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Your healthcare provider can help you become enrolled in these registries.
**Warnings - Kisunla can cause serious allergic and infusion-related reactions.**Do not receive Kisunla if you have serious allergic reactions to donanemab-azbt or any of the ingredients in Kisunla. Symptoms may include swelling of the face, lips, mouth, or eyelids, problems breathing, hives, chills, irritation of skin, nausea, vomiting, sweating, headache, or chest pain. You will be monitored for at least 30 minutes after you receive Kisunla for any reaction.**Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have these symptoms or any reaction during or after a Kisunla infusion.**
